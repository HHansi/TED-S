1185506876915671041	Please explain where exactly in WA or PD it states that we cannot have an independent tax policy. Even inside EU we have one (at least for now). Do not lose #brexit by making things up and engaging in your own #ProjectFear. That is not the @brexitparty_uk that I joined https://t.co/oJIRXHpQI3	negative

1185497339512930304	On rainy day over 3 yrs ago leave voters told me that change was needed &amp; things couldn’t get worse. They deserve chance to say if this deal with its threat to union &amp; risk to workers rights is the change they voted for. Today I’ll march for people to have final say #PeoplesVote https://t.co/hfvP7P1FBR	positive
